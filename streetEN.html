                <p>As its name suggests, street is practiced in the street, without rules or constraints. The goal is to use street furniture to perform figures. The rider uses inclined planes, walls, handrails, low walls on the side of the stairs, and any other installation not provided for this purpose. The emblematic accessory of a street BMX is what is called peg , a kind of oversized extension of the wheel axles that allows you to grind (slide), therefore to do figures on all kinds of obstacles.</p>

                <p>The street is born from the absence of skateparks and this discipline is becoming in vogue in videos and specialized magazines. The current trend is to go street without brakes.</p>
                 
                <p>Another very strong current trend is to string figures as smoothly as possible, over several obstacles, and therefore to create a "line".</p>
                
                <p>The basis of street is the bunny hop technique which consists of taking off the two wheels without a springboard.</p>
