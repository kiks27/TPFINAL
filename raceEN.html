                <p>The race is the most common practice BMX.</p>

                <p>Much of the race is done at the start. Someone who starts well and who doesn't make any mistakes afterwards, in general, wins the race. It is not a question of making figures during the show jumping under penalty of the yellow / red card type sanction.</p>
                
                <p>A race competition is comparable to a sprint where the sprinter has to cross hurdles over an average distance of 300 meters, with in addition, slight drops.</p>
                
                <p>The pilots are positioned on a slope , called a start hill, or start , with the front wheel pressed against a retractable grid.</p>
