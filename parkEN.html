                <p>The park is the most famous discipline of freestyle , in particular thanks to contests such as the X Games , Gravity Games , FISE ,  etc. A skatepark is most often made with wooden ramps (indoors) and concrete outdoors.</p>

                <p>The principle of the park is to perform figures on the modules present in the skatepark area ( quarters  : inclined planes, curbs , rails , walls, etc.). It is, in a way, the combination of all the disciplines of BMX because, thanks to the diversity of the modules, it is possible to perform aerial figures as in dirt , on a fun-box , or grinds , as in street , on curbs and rails , and figures on the ground, on platforms, quarters , as in flat .</p>
                 
                <p>The park's problem is its lack of infrastructure. Indeed, cities are rarely equipped with the structures necessary for practice, so riders turn to the street (with the few disadvantages that it generates: rare degradation of street furniture) or to dirt because it is sometimes easier to dig a few bumps in the dirt than build a skatepark .</p>
